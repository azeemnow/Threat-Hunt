<h1> Tactic: Discovery
Technique: Security Software Discovery (T1063)  </h1>
<h2> From MITRE ATT&CK </h2>

Adversaries may attempt to get a listing of security software, configurations, defensive tools, and sensors that are installed on the system. This may include things such as local firewall rules and anti-virus. Adversaries may use the information from Security Software Discovery during automated discovery to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether or not the adversary fully infects the target and/or attempts specific actions.
