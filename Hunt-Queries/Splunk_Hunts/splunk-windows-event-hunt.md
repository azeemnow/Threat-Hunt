# Splunk Security Event Hunt: Monitoring Critical Windows Event Codes

## Description

This Splunk search is designed to identify and monitor significant Windows event logs to detect potential security incidents, including suspicious logins, account modifications, privilege escalations, logon failures, and firewall-related activities. By analyzing various event codes generated by Windows systems, this search aims to provide insights into system behavior, helping administrators and security analysts pinpoint areas of concern and potential threats in their environment.

## Value

This search provides critical visibility into key areas of Windows event logs that may indicate a security breach or an ongoing attack. By focusing on event codes related to logon attempts, account modifications, privilege escalation, password changes, and system activity (like firewall changes), this query aids security professionals in:

- **Detecting Unusual Activity**: For example, repeated failed logon attempts (Event Codes 4625, 529, 530, etc.) may indicate a brute force attack or credential stuffing.
- **Identifying Privilege Escalation**: Events like 4672 (privilege escalation) can be used to detect suspicious elevation of user rights, which is a key indicator of a malicious insider or attacker.
- **Auditing System Changes**: Event codes related to changes in firewall rules or account modifications help to ensure that only authorized personnel are making security-related changes (e.g., Event Codes 4946, 4697).
- **Detecting Account Misuse**: Event codes like 4738 (account modification) and 4767 (account unlocked) provide insight into account activity that could be tied to malicious behavior.

## Explanation

- **EventCode Filtering**: The search uses `eval` to categorize Windows Event Codes into logical labels (e.g., “Logon attempt”, “Account modification”, etc.). This makes it easier for analysts to interpret logs.
- **Statistics Aggregation**: The `stats` command aggregates data by event, counting occurrences and listing associated users, source machines, and destination addresses. This helps highlight common patterns of activity, identifying potential incidents based on frequency.
- **Sorting**: The final `sort count` helps identify the most common events, prioritizing what needs to be investigated first.
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: By including a wide range of event codes, this query provides comprehensive monitoring of different vectors—ranging from user authentication to firewall manipulation.

## Conclusion

This search is an essential tool for security analysts and administrators working in environments with Windows systems. It helps highlight potential security threats, enabling a proactive approach to monitoring and incident response. Whether you’re concerned about unauthorized access attempts, privilege escalation, or malicious changes to system configurations, this search can help uncover the necessary data for further investigation.
